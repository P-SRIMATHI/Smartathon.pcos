st.markdown("""
## üìå What is PCOS?
PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age. 
It can lead to irregular menstrual cycles, excessive hair growth, acne, and infertility.

## ‚ö† Symptoms of PCOS:
- Irregular periods or no periods at all
- Excess androgen (leading to excess facial or body hair)
- Polycystic ovaries (enlarged ovaries with fluid-filled sacs)
- Weight gain or difficulty losing weight
- Thinning hair or hair loss
- Acne or oily skin

## üîç Causes of PCOS:
The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but common factors include:
- **Hormonal imbalances** (such as high levels of insulin and androgens)
- **Genetics** (family history may increase risk)
- **Insulin resistance** (leads to weight gain and metabolic issues)
- **Inflammation** (chronic low-grade inflammation may contribute)
